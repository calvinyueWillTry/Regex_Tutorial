## Regex Components
Matching a Hex Value (email): `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`
### Anchors
It begins and ends with a backtick and forward slash because everything in between are considered "literals", so the `/ literal values /` have to be wrapped here.
The characters ^ and $ are both considered to be anchors.  The Circumflex ^ anchors the beginning of the sequences, and the dollar $ anchors the end.
